# ArcGIS-Python
Working with shapefiles and dataframe in Python Notebooks (based on Jupyter Notebooks) in ArcGIS

This code downloads an ArcGIS shapefile from an URL, unzips, reads, and converts to a pandas dataframe so that the data can be processed and visualized. 

In this exercise, we will work with the Drought Vulnerability Score data available from the Department of Water Resources, California. The data can be downloaded from the following link:
